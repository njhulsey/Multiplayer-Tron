# Multiplayer-Tron
I always wanted to make multiplayer games because I wanted to share my games with my friends. So, I programmed a multiplayer tron light bike game during my junior year Christmas break.

WHAT I LEARNED:
- UDP Java (Connections)
- How to handle packets
- Drawing, input handling, game logic, and objects

HOW TO PLAY:
1) run the server
2) run the client (selecting "no" option when prompted to run the server)
3) Connect to IP Address (Worked best with LogMeIn Hamachi or 127.0.0.1 for local address)
4) Enjoy playing :)
