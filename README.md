# Multiplayer-Tron
I wanted to make multiplayer games because I wanted my friends to play my games with me. So, I programed a multiplayer tron light bike game during my junior year Christmas break.

WHAT I LEARNED:
- UDP Java
- How to handle packets

HOW TO PLAY:
1) run the server
2) run the client (selecting "no" option when prompted to run the server)
3) Connect to IP Address (Worked best with LogMeIn Hamachi)
4) Enjoy playing :)
